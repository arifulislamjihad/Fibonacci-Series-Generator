What is the Fibonacci Series?
The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers before it. It starts with zero and one:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ...
Each new number is formed by the sum of the previous two numbers. For example:
1st term = 0 [default]
2nd term = 1 [default]
3rd term = 1st term + 2nd term = 0+1=1
4th term = 2nd term + 3rd term = 1+1=2
5th term = 3rd term + 4th term = 1+2=3
6th term = 4th term + 5th term = 2+3=5
7th term = 5th term + 6th term = 3 + 5 = 8
8th term = 6th term + 7th term = 5 + 8 = 13
9th term = 7th term + 8th term = 8 + 13 = 21
10th term = 8th term + 9th term = 13 + 21 = 34
Mathematical formula:
F(n)=F(n−1)+F(n−2)
where,
F(0)=0
F(1)=1
Thus, as the value of n increases, new numbers are obtained.


above is clue. Question is below:
Question

Overview: 

Write a Python program to generate and display the Fibonacci series based on user input. 


Note: 

Avoid using AI tools, as it is essential to build skills independently for your long-term career growth. 


Tasks: 

The program should provide the following options: 

• Generate the Fibonacci series up to a specific number of terms. 

• Generate the Fibonacci series up to a specific maximum value.



Requirements: 

• Ask the user for the number of terms they want in the series (e.g., 6) 

o Generate and display the Fibonacci series containing exactly that many terms. 

• Ask the user for a maximum value (e.g., 10). 

o Generate and display all Fibonacci numbers less than or equal to the given value. 

• Use functions to implement the Fibonacci logic. Create at least one function for generating the series. 

• Validate the user input: o Ensure the number of terms and maximum value are non-negative integers. 

• Handle cases where the user provides invalid input gracefully. 

• Display the series in a well-formatted way.
